My goal  is to learn  something new in this course. May be I will able to get a job (dreamy). Why I chose programming because it's interesting and it keeps the mind in a good shape. Programming also changes thinking in everyday life, because some processes or repetitive actions in my life I'm  trying to simplify or improve.
